# MAPWAPS

The following GitHub Repository details my contribution to the MAPWAPS project. MAPWAPS or the Mapping of Woody Alien Plants, is a South African initiative aiming to mitigate the harm cause by Invasive Alien Plants (IAP) with specific focus on their water usage. My role was to create a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm that estimates evapotranspiration (ET) from satellite imagery 

- Note: ET is the combination of evaporation and transpiration, it is an integral component of the hydrological cycle and a true indicator of water usage.
