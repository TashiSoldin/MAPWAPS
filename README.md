# MAPWAPS

The following GitHub Repository details my contribution to the MAPWAPS project. MAPWAPS or the Mapping of Woody Alien Plant Species, is a South African initiative aiming to mitigate the harm cause by Invasive Alien Plants (IAPs) with specific focus on their water usage. My role was to create a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm that estimates evapotranspiration (ET) from satellite imagery 

- Note: ET is the combination of evaporation and transpiration, it is an integral component of the hydrological cycle and a key indicator of water usage.

## Navigating this Repo

### The Components of this Repo
The folders that are included in this repository and a brief descriptions are as follows: 
- Code: this folder contains the Jupyter Notebooks that were used for data processing and machine learning models:
    - Dataset Aquisition, Processing & Curation: contains the Jupyter Notebooks responsible for data extraction, processing, collation and combination to produce a final dataset that can be used for ML input.
    - Machine Learning Models: contains the Jupyter Notebooks that train, validate and test the 5 ML models implemented in this project. Multiple models allow for comparison and determination of the model most applicable to this context.
- Results: this folder contains the results produced by the ML models in the form of tabulated data and graphic plots (loss plots and regression plots to benchmark ML model perfromance).
- Report: this folder contains my submitted thesis write up that will provide context and insight into the content and purpose of this GitHub Repo.

Each folder has its own README.md with more detailed explanations on the folder's contents.
