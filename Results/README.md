# Results

This section of the GitHub Repository stores the results of the five implemented machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely: (1) Neural Network (NN), (2) Recurrant Neural Network (RNN), (3) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), (4) Random Forest (RF) and (5) State Vectore Machine (SVM).

Each model was tested on 8 combinations of data - these were as a result of exploring all variations of 3 parameters, namely: (1) size of dataset, (2) inclusion or exclusion of date variable and (3) applying normalisation to the data or not. This results in 24 tests perfromed per ML model - 120 in total. This exhaustive testing and its perfromance results are discussed in the Project Report.

The result data is tabulated in an excel spreadsheet and the plots for each test are available. All ML models produce regression plots but the NN, RNN and LSTM also produce loss graphs to show training and validation loss.
